# Subtle Type Instability in Julia Function

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Julia related to type instability. The function `myfunction` returns different types depending on the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues in larger programs.

The bug is highlighted in `bug.jl`, and a corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.jl`.
